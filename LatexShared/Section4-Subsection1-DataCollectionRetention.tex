\subsection{Cloud Monitoring Data Collection and Retention}

\begin{itemize}
\item{[Sep 2015 - Oct 2015]:} Data collection. 1) Evaluate various monitoring tools, and choose one or several tools that satisfy our project requirements including performance, scalability, elasticity. Collect physical system information of MOC using monitoring tools we chose. 2) Evaluate metering tools for OpenStack, such as Ceilometer and StackTach. Use the metering tool that better suits our needs and also produce less overhead, and collect per-tenant information for virtual resources usage. 
\item{[Oct 2015 - Nov 2015]:}Data retention. 1) We will evaluate several databases and choose databases that suits our needs. 2) We will also need to evaluate centralized or distributed database storage system for our environment and design data schema. 3) We will integrate the monitoring tools and our storage.
