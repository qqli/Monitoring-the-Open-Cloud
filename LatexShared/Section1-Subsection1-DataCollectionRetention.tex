\subsection{Cloud Monitoring Data Collection and Retention}


In order to expose the cloud performance characteristics and utilization data to users as well as researchers, we will build a monitoring platform that can collect and retain the performance and utilization data of the cloud. The challenges for this phase are 1) how to collect operational data of the cloud from different sources in a scalable way without impacting the performance of the components being monitored, and 2)how to retain the data in an organized way and to optimize the retention for data analysis.

As cloud environment is a complicated system, and it can be modeled in seven layers: facility, network, hardware, OS, middleware, application, and the user~\cite{spring2011monitoring}. Monitoring of these seven layers can be grouped to high-level and low-level monitoring. High-level monitoring is related to cloud virtual system which is composed of middleware, application, and user layer ~\cite{Aceto2013}. Low-level monitoring is related to cloudâ€™s physical system which is composed of the other four layers. Challenges arise when there can be different monitoring tools for different levels or even different layers of the cloud. We need to investigate into various monitoring tools and logs to get the performance and utilization data of the cloud. In addition, as we want to use monitoring tools that have less performance influence in components of the cloud. It is also important to evaluate those tools in terms of scalability, elasticity and reliability.

For retaining the data collected from the cloud, we need to evaluate different databases and choose databases that suit our needs for retaining large set of data as well as easiness for displaying the data. Some monitoring tools come with a database, while other monitoring tools does not retain the data they collected. Whether to store all the data collected in one large database or store it in separate databases as provided by some of the monitoring tools become an issue for us. Furthermore, as scalability and reliability is desired in cloud monitoring, it is also critical to evaluate distributed databases. For the database chosen, we need to design a proper database schema for the large set of data collected from different levels or layers of the cloud.
