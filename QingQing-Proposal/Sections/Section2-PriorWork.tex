\subsection{Data Transformation and Visualization}

For commercial platforms, some of the major companies such as Amazon and Microsoft, already provide monitoring services. CloudWatch, a monitoring service provided by Amazon, only have services of monitoring virtual resources such as EC2~\cite{Aceto2013}. Amazon does not provide low-level monitoring (physical machines' information). AzureWatch, provided by Microsoft, also does not provide the monitoring information of low-level cloud. 

  We also explore some open source solutions that are similar to our idea of monitoring the cloud and exposing the information to users. PCMONS ~\cite{chaves2011toward} is an open source pull-based monitoring solution. However, it has three levels of monitoring agents for physical level monitoring, which can cause network congestion and it does not provide a mapping between virtual resources and physical resources. 

  GMonE~\cite{montes2013gmone} is a monitoring tool that can both monitor physical system and virtual system. However, it doesn't specify it can provide a mapping between physical systems and virtual systems. In addition, this solution has excessive use of monitoring agents and databases. It imposes the installation of agents on each VM and a database for each user. 

  DARGOS~\cite{povedano2013dargos}  is an agent-based, publish/subscribe monitoring solution for multi-tenant clouds. Administrators can see the whole cloud and each tenant has its own view of the cloud. It supports several distributed databases set up across the cloud, which enables scalability and fault-tolerance. MonPaaS~\cite{alcaraz2015monpaas} is a monitoring tool that provides monitoring functions similar to DARGOS, information of physical as well as virtual resources and a mapping between virtual and physical resources. 

  As we propose experiment in the MOC, which has OpenStack deployment, we will study exsiting monitoring solutions and see how we can combine exsiting mointoring tools for building our solution without developing new monitoring tools.
