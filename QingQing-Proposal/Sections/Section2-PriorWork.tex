\subsection{Data Transformation and Visualization}

There exists commercial solutions running on top of public clouds that visualize cloud usage. For example, Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service provided by Amazon. It can monitor virtual resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon DynamoDB tables, etc. but it does not provide monitoring of physical resources. 

Academic studies that provide more complete monitoring solutions~\cite{chaves2011toward, montes2013gmone, povedano2013dargos, alcaraz2015monpaas} generally focus on either providing enhanced solution to cloud providers or provide solutions that do not carry the concerns we have such as being privacy preserving.
