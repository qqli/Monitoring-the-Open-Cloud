\section{Plan and Schedule}
\label{sec:Plan}

\begin{itemize}
\item{[Sep 2015 - Oct 2015]:} Consider many use cases for users of MOC and come up with a list of metrics that are useful for users about MOC. Use existing monitoring tool in MOC, Sensu, to get physical system information of MOC. Explore other monitoring tools that can get physical system information can evaluate them with Sensu. Collect the information as need from the monitoring tool we chose.
\item{[Oct 2015 - Nov 2015]:} Evaluate metering tools, which are used for calculating how much resource a tenant has used. The options now are ceilometer and StackTach. We need to consider the overhead and quantity of the messages. The we will choose a better choice as our metering tool for mappings. Installation and setup of the metering tool that we chose after evaluation. Write a program for mappings for each project using the metering tool we chose after evaluation.
\item{[Nov 2015 - Dec 2015]:} Explore the data that we can get from network switches, and write programs that can show how the physical hosts are connected via networks. 
\item{[Dec 2015 - Jan 2016]:} Evaluate databases and decide if we should use multiple databases or just one database. If we choose one database, we need to come up with a schema for storing all the data. If we choose multiple databases, we need to come up with a way to have a good connection of the data. 
\item{[Jan 2016 - Feb 2016]:} Using the data we collect and stored in the database, we need to make a visualization tool that can visualize both physical system information and a mapping between physical resources and virtual resources for each user. 
\item{[Feb 2016 - Mar 2016]:} Continue making the visualization tool and also come up with use cases for users and design the API for them. 
\item{[Mar 2016 - Apr 2016]:} Write programs that can provide API for users. 
\item{[Apr 2016 - Jun 2016]:} Refine all parts of the project. Write the report.
