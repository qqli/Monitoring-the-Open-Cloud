\subsection{Cloud Monitoring Data Visualization}
\begin{itemize}
\item{[Nov 2015 - Dec 2015]:} Find out the optimization possibilities in order to support scalability by doing more researches. Design and write programs for aggregations based on the metrics that users are concerned about. Store more data which comes not only from the monitoring tools, but also from aggregation programs. Maintain the database so that we can do queries on larger set of data that is generated and collected from the cloud.  
\item{[Dec 2015 - Jan 2016]:} Design and write the API for users that they can use for more convenient queries . If we decide to use several databases, we will also write APIs that set up connections among different databases. 
\item{[Jan 2016 - Feb 2016]:} Continuing writing APIs for users. Making the API such that it can ensure security of the cloud and privacy of users. 
\item{[Feb 2016 - Mar 2016]:} Using the data we collect and stored in the database, we need to make a visualization tool that can visualize both physical system information and a mapping between physical resources and virtual resources for each user. During this month, the visualization of the whole cloud, how the physical devices are connected and what are conditions of physical machines will be provided.  
\item{[Mar 2016 - Apr 2016]:} Continuing in making the visualization tool. The visualization of mapping between physical resources and virtual resources will be provided to users during this phase.  
\item{[Apr 2016 - May 2016]:} Refine all parts of the project. Write the report.
