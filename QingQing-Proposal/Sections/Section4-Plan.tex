%\subsection{Data Transformation and Visualization}
\begin{itemize}
\item{[Sep 2015 - Nov 2015]:} Virtual layer data collection. Evaluate metering tools for OpenStack, such as Ceilometer and StackTach. Use the metering tool that better suits our needs and also produce less overhead, and collect per-tenant information for virtual resources usage. 
\item{[Nov 2015 - Dec 2015]:} Identify an initial set of important queries, and develop a simple visualization tool. Study the optimization opportunities to support queries efficiently, exploring the relavent literature. 
\item{[Dec 2015 - Jan 2016]:} Develop various transformations and correlations between information from different data sources. 
\item{[Jan 2016 - Feb 2016]:} Design and write the API for users that they can use for more convenient queries. Iterate on queries and transformations. 
\item{[Feb 2016 - Mar 2016]:} Update the end-user visualization tool to use the API, and iterate on above. 
\item{[Mar 2016 - May 2016]:} Refine all parts of the project, work with other researchers and MOC partners to exploit the platform. 
\end{itemize}
