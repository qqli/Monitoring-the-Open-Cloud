\subsection{Data Transformation and Visualization}
\begin{itemize}
\item{[Nov 2015 - Dec 2015]:} Identify an initial set of important queries, and develop a simple visualization tool. Study the optimization opportunities to support queries efficiently, exploring the relavent literature. 
\item{[Dec 2015 - Jan 2016]:} Develop various transformations and correlations between information from different data sources. 
\item{[Jan 2016 - Feb 2016]:} Design and write the API for users that they can use for more convenient queries. Iterate on queries and transformations. 
\item{[Feb 2016 - Mar 2016]:} Update the end-user visualization tool to use the API, and iterate on above. 
\item{[Mar 2016 - May 2016]:} Refine all parts of the project, work with other researchers and MOC partners to exploit the platform. 
\end{itemize}
