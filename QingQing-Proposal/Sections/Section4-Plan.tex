\subsection{Cloud Monitoring Data Visualization}
\begin{itemize}
\item{[Nov 2015 - Dec 2015]:} Find out the optimization possibilities in order to support scalability by doing more researches. Design and write programs for aggregations based on the metrics that users are concerned about. Store more data which comes not only from the monitoring tools, but also from aggregation programs. Maintain the database so that we can do queries on larger set of data that is generated and collected from the cloud.  
\item{[Dec 2015 - Jan 2016]:} Design and write the API for users that they can use for more convenient queries . If we decide to use several databases, we will also write APIs that set up connections among different databases. 
\item{[Jan 2016 - Feb 2016]:} Continuing writing APIs for users. Making the API such that it can ensure security of the cloud and privacy of users. 
\item{[Feb 2016 - Mar 2016]:} Design the end-user visualization tool with considerations of the data we collected, transformed, and aggregated and of the metrics users are interested in. Develop the tool such that shows status of the cloud and how the physical devices are connected.  
\item{[Mar 2016 - Apr 2016]:} Continuing in developing the visualization tool, which will focus in developing the mapping of virtual resources and user specific physical resource utilizations. 
\item{[Apr 2016 - May 2016]:} Refine all parts of the project. Write the report.
\end{itemize}
