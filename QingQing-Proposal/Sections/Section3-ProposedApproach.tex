\subsection{Cloud Monitoring Data Visualization}
  
  After building the platform that is functioned to collect and retain certain amount of data. Hua and I will focus on different parts of the project. I will separate my part of the project to three sections. First, as the project goes along, we will get larger set of data. This part will focus in maintaining the data collected and store it in a way that is well organized and optimized for querying. Storing data that are less useful seem to be a waste of storage and can lower the query speed. So we will do literature reviews, and find out demands of users when they consider using a cloud. Based on users? demand information and users concern such as prices, performance, energy efficiency and time, we can come up with a list of metrics that are useful to collect. For each of the component in the cloud, we need to find parameters that can influence the factors that users are concerned with, such as performance. Furthermore, we need store some useful aggregations of data. People sometimes are more concerned about the usage over a period of time than just instantaneous data. However, monitoring tools usually get instantaneous data only. We will define a schema that can store large set of historical data such as hourly cpu utilization or daily cpu utilization of a compute node.
  
  Second, after retaining all the useful information in one or more database, we need to expose instantaneous cloud operational data  and some historical data as stated above to users via API in a programmable manner. Literature reviews are needed to explore the queries users want to have when they are using the cloud. For example, we will write an API that can provide users a mapping between their virtual resources and cloud physical resources. This particular API will tell them conditions of  the hosts for their VMs and also present them the physical networks of their VMs. 
  
  Third, with the data collected and stored in the database/databases, we will make a data visualization tool. We need to explore how to present the data in a fashionable and readable way. This data visualization tool should show basic descriptions of the cloud, instantaneous usage of the cloud, and the mapping of physical machines and virtual machines for users. We will also explore open source visualization tools, such as Grafana [14] for visualizing and analyzing data within a time range.
