\subsection{Cloud Monitoring Data Visualization}
  
  After building the platform that is functioned to collect and retain certain amount of data. We will work in exposing data that is clear and useful to users. As the raw data generated from the running cloud come from different sources and maybe stored in different databases, we will first aggregate the data collected from MOC. As cloud is a complex system, even physical system has many layers. Many compute nodes forms a rack, racks of computes and storage system forms a cluster, and a cloud can have many clusters. The data we collected is mainly at compute node level. However, if we want to expose the data more meaningfully, we need to aggregate it to cluster level. In addition, people sometimes are more concerned about the usage over a period of time than just instantaneous data. However, monitoring tools usually get instantaneous data only. We will define a schema that can store large set of historical data such as hourly cpu utilization or daily cpu utilization of a compute node. Then we will aggregate the data based on users' needs, we will do literature reviews, and find out demands of users when they consider to use a cloud. Based on users' demands information, such as price, performance, energy efficiency and time, we can come up with a list of metrics that are useful to aggregate with. We can also store these aggregations to the database for later use.
  
  Second, after retaining all the useful information in one or more database, we need to expose instantaneous cloud operational data  and some historical data as stated above to users via API in a programmable manner. Literature reviews are needed to explore the queries users want to have when they are using the cloud. For example, we will write an API that can provide users a mapping between their virtual resources and cloud physical resources. This particular API will tell them conditions of  the hosts for their VMs and also present them the physical networks of their VMs. 
  
  Third, with the data collected and stored in the database/databases, we will make a data visualization tool. We need to explore how to present the data in a fashionable and readable way. This data visualization tool should show basic descriptions of the cloud, instantaneous usage of the cloud, and the mapping of physical machines and virtual machines for users. We will also explore open source visualization tools, such as Grafana [14] for visualizing and analyzing data within a time range.
