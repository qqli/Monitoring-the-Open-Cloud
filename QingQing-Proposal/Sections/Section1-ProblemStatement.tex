%This project will be composed of two phases. The first phase, Data Collection and Retention, will be a platform building phase that collects and stores raw data from the MOC. It will be a shared effort with another master student.  
%The second phase, Data Transformation and Visualization, will first extend the platform by filtering and transforming the raw data collected from the cloud such that a number of query sets can be efficiently performed over the data. We will then exercise and refine the platform by developing an end-user tool that visualizes both the status of the cloud, and the user’s virtual cloud resources. The goal of this tool will be to provide users the kind of information they have to reverse engineer on existing clouds to optimize their applications.

\subsection{Data Collection and Retention}

Cloud environments are composed of seven layers  (facility, network, hardware, OS, middleware, application, and the user~\cite{spring2011monitoring}). knowing the interactions and correlations of different components from different layers is complicated and we have not found a single monitoring tool that can collect operational data from all the layers of the cloud. The goal of this project for this phase is to collect virtual resource data of the cloud which can come from OS, middleware, application and user layer of cloud and to retain the data so that we can combine it with the physical resource data of the cloud. For example, information about a VM that is collected from a performance tool can be used to connect to information about what node this VM is running on that is collected from the hypervisor. This information can then be connected to the information collected from physical layers which shows the status of the physical nodes. 

The research challenges for this phase are 1) how to collect large set of operational data of the cloud virtual system which can bring little overhead to the system being monitored, and 2) how to retain or migrate the data of cloud virtual resources from a temporal database to a long-term database in a scalable manner, and to optimize the retention for data analysis.

Although no tool can monitor all layers of the cloud, we have found out a set of open source tools that are specific to different layers. We believe that we can deploy a combination of existing tools for collecting all the data we need, so that no new monitoring tools will be built. Data collection part for this project will be evaluating different monitoring tools that can collect data from virtual system of the cloud. 

A variety of different databases  for retaining the data collected from monitoring tool need to be evaluated based on criteria like scalability and performance. We will also need to consider about the migration of the data that is already collected in a default database to a single database or several databases that is distributed across the whole cloud.

%\subsection{Cloud Monitoring Data Transformation and Visualization}
%During this phase, we will extend the platform we built in the previous phase by filtering and transforming the retained data. Then we will provide an API  for efficient queries and an end-user tool that can visualize the status of the cloud as well as user specific utilization of the cloud.  

%The data collected from the cloud is hard to use and there are some challenges for us to filter and transform the data. First, for monitoring the same cloud, we use different monitoring tools for different levels or even layers, which means that we need a mechanism to relate data from different levels or layers. Second, the data we collected from the system is raw, which means that users may not know what does the data represents and the data need to be aggregated based on users’ demands and use cases. For example, the utilization information come from monitoring tools is compute based, we can aggregate the compute utilizations to get utilizations of a cluster. 

%Having a platform that collects and retains data that represents the status of the cloud, however, is not enough. First, as database schema may change or we may have several databases for storing all the information, direct access to database may not be an efficient way. Second, reading documentations and statistics for large set of data is not yet clear to cloud users, especially for end users. Third, exposing the data of the whole platform means risking the security of the cloud and privacy of users. So we plan to provide an API and an end-user visualization tool for showing cloud status and users’ virtual resources.
