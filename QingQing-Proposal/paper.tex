\begin{abstract}

Cloud computing has many intrinsic advantages as well as some challenges, such as performance unpredictability. Public cloud, which is usually owned by a single provider, is rather opaque to users. It does not provide information at hardware level to users, which restricts usersâ€™ decision making when experimenting in clouds. This kind of data can only be obtained through monitoring the cloud and carefully retaining of the data. We will use Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC) as our cloud environment. MOC is the first cloud that aims at letting many vendors participate in a cloud, in which monitoring can be more meaningful,for the reason that users will have more choices, such as brands, in MOC environment. We propose that by exposing some extent of data to users can help them to make wise choices. However, cloud monitoring also leaves many challenges. In our project, we need to explore what data to be collected, evaluate different data collecting tools and evaluate databases. Then we will create a data visualization tool for users, which will show connections and conditions of physical system and a mapping between virtual and physical resources.
