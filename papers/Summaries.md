##DARGOS: A highly adaptable and saclable monitoring architecture for mutli-tenant Clouds

In the paper ‘DARGOS: A highly adaptable and scalable monitoring architecture for multi-tenant clouds’, the author claims that resource needs of applications depends not only on service types, but also on cloud’s dynamic conditions. The author also claims that incorrect estimations of cloud may lead to misleading results. So they proposed Distributed Architecture for Resource management and monitoring in clouds(DARGOS), a monitoring architecture based on data-centric DDS push-based publish/subscribe paradigm, and also combines automatic discovery, filtering capabilities, asynchronous event handling. DARGOS use NMAs(Node monitoring agent) to collect data from local nodes and publish them to subscribed nodes. NSAs(Node Supervisor Agent) are used to receive, store and maintain data collected from NMAs. NMAs are installed in every monitored host, and each tenant has an NSA that receive monitoring information(Haven’t figure out where to install NSAs and the databases). In an OpenStack environment, NMAs are installed in every compute node and nova controller. They also created a DARGOS scheduler, which use the monitoring data from NSA, for allocating resources dynamically.
Because each tenant is a subscriber that subscribes the monitoring data, DARGOS can provide suitable data for tenants based on their use of the cloud as well as administrators who want to know information of the whole cloud. I still need to check if DARGOS has a single database or each NSA has its own database. The network traffic is reduced significantly, for DARGOS only send data to related tenants(subscribers). For the network evaluation in OpenStack environment,  it got good results, but the experiment only contain one NSA and three NMAs. Moreover, OpenStack depends on AMQP and mySQL for basic communications except from monitoring. The measurements may not be correct just extract DARGOS network usage and compare it with OpenStack network usage (Maybe I am wrong because I do not know how to measure the traffic of only OpenStack monitoring function).


##MonPaaS: An Adaptive Monitoring Platform as a Service for Cloud Computing Infrastructures and Services

MonPaaS is said to be an adaptive monitoring platform that can monitor virtual and physical resources as well as keeping a mapping between virtual and physical resources. It can also provide independent monitoring for providers and users. Furthermore, it allows users to configure and customize the resources and services they would like to monitor. MonPaaS listens to OpenStack message queue and get the messages of physical as well as virtual resources change information.
