\subsection{VM Characterization}

The first step in this phase of the project is to create a useful categorization of applications/VMs.  We will explore different catagorization approaches based on: 1) interest to users; 2) value for research and tools than could exploit the characterization, and 3) feasibility of identification. To obtain this information, beyond continuing to explore the related research, we plan to discuss any proposed characterization, and collect requires from industry collaborators of MOC and researchers who have interest in building higher level tools. 

As a next step, we will implement a tool to collect the "ground truth" from users by modifying the IaaS UI so that users can indicate what kind of application they will run in their VMs during VM creation.  The goal of this tool is to enable user adding labels of VM's manually to construct the training data for our prediction modeling analysis.

o select performance data relevant
for all the VMs that we have 
we will use techniques to figure out which features are indicative.  We will use L1 regularizationfor feature secection.  Among features look at pearson correlation...
Bsaed on this,w e will have an understanding of what can be used in a efficient fashion.  Which will drive the next step

o now try to characterize VMs we know nothing about... how will you do that - clustering 

We will divide the data up, and predict accuracy.

As a stretch goal, we will explore if this cna be done in real time, and exposed through the UI.
