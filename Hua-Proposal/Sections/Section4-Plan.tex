\section{Plan and Schedule}
\label{sec:Plan}

\begin{itemize}
\item{[Sep 2015 - Oct 2015]:} Data collection. 1) Evaluate various monitoring tools, and choose one or several tools that satisfy our project requirements including performance, scalability, elasticity. Collect physical system information of MOC using monitoring tools we chose. 2) Evaluate metering tools for OpenStack, such as Ceilometer and StackTach. Use the metering tool that better suits our needs and also produces less overhead, and collect per-tenant information for virtual resources usage.
\item{[Oct 2015 - Nov 2015]:} 1) We will evaluate several databases and choose databases that fulfill our needs. 2) We will also need to evaluate centralized or distributed database storage system for our environment and design data schema. 3) We will integrate the monitoring tools with our storage.
\item{[Nov 2015 - Dec 2015]:} 1) create the VMs category 2) develop the tool for user to select the VMs functionality on top of OpenStack user interface. 3) finish features selection for predction
\item{[Dec 2015 - Jan 2016]:} 1) evaluate different algorithm and choose the best fit 2) implement the algorithm
\item{[Jan 2016 - Feb 2016]:} Final report describing research, development, implementation, testing will be written and edited. Works will be presented.
\end{itemize}
