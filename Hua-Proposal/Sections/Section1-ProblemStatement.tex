The first phase, Data Collection and Retention, will be a platform building phase that collects and stores raw data from the MOC. It will be a shared effort with another master student. The second phase, VMs characterization, will first analyze the data collected during the first phase to identify the categories of the VMs and build a tool to determine the classes of the VMs. The goal of this tool is to help users and research communities understand an applicationâ€™s performance characteristics and be able to produce models that are capable of predicting performance in current and future systems for optimization.\input{../LatexShared/Section1-Subsection1-DataCollectionRetention.tex}\input{Sections/Section1-Subsection2-VMsCharacterizationPrediction.tex}
