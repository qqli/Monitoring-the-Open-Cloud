The first phase, Data Collection and Retention, will be a platform building phase that collects and stores raw data from the MOC. It will be a shared effort with another master student. The second phase, VM characterization, will be a data analysis phase, where we will build a tool that utilizes the data collected during the first phase to characterize the VMs running on top of the cloud. The output of this tool can be used for optimizations on various layers of the cloud such as making better VM placement decisions, suggesting VM configurations, etc.\input{../LatexShared/Section1-Subsection1-DataCollectionRetention.tex}\input{Sections/Section1-Subsection2-VMsCharacterizationPrediction.tex}
