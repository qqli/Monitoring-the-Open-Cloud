\subsection{VM Characterization}
VM characterization is the task of identifying why a VM is used for. For example, is the VM running a Web Server, a caching server, a database application, etcâ€¦ VM characterization is important because it enables performance optimizations such as, suggesting best VM configurations for different VM classes and making intelligent VM placement decisions. 

The research challenges in this phase can be listed as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Identifying possible VM classes: coming up with a complete VM functionality classification table
\item Identifying meaningful/useful features, doing feature selection among many data sources and features, 
\item Identifying best classification algorithm among the multiple possible classification algorithms, 
\item Performing scalable/real-time classification, if possible with a small amount of data after a short amount of execution time, to enable early optimizations.  
\end{itemize}
