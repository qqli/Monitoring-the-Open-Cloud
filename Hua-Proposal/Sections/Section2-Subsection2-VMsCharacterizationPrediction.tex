\subsection{VM Characterization and Performance Prediction}


Research on performance optimization~\cite{Yang2005,Matsunaga2010,OguraM10}
is based on data analysis and modeling techniques that dependes on an understanding of the applications~\cite{Shan2008}; VM characterization is fundamental to these optimization efforts. 

VM characterization is not a well studied problem in the literature. Probably most related work to ours is~\cite{Derrick2014}, which characterizes and models Google applications and jobs, based on a one-month Google trace data from a large-scale Google data center, and clusters similar jobs based on resource utilization. They do not identify possible application classes beforehand and hence they came up with a clustering solution. Remotely related to VM characterization are studies on VM performance prediction~\cite{Matsunaga2010, Samuel2013}. \cite{Matsunaga2010} tries to predict the time and resources that will be consumed by a cloud application using system and input data characteristics and \cite{Samuel2013} try to predict response time of applications on the cloud using resource utilization metrics available when a VM is created.
