\begin{abstract}

With the rapid growth and wide adoption of cloud computing, the complexity of cloud is increasing with a lot of challenges for researchers, for instance, performance optimization in heterogeneous infrastructures. With the development of machine learning and data mining, they have become more appealing research methodology for these cloud researches. But the cloud, which is usually owned by single cloud provider, is too opaque to cloud users. Cloud is hiding the performance and utilization of system resources to users, which restricts the decision making of users as well as the research capabilities. Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC) is the cloud environment where we will study about collecting and exposing data of cloud to users in a reliable, durable, scalable, secure way. However, monitoring cloud and storing the data still leaves us many challenges. In this project, we will investigate different monitoring tools and different databases, collect data and retain information in a form amenable to analysis. For future user data analysis, such as machine learning or data mining, I will build a tool to gather the application level usage of instances, and develop a program to categorize and predict the application the user run in a new created instance for proof of concept (POC). This will be a cooperative project I will share with Qingqing Li. While her goal is to develop a platform to expose data of cloud to user, my goal is to build tools to enhance the user research capability with machine learning and data mining.
