\begin{abstract}

With the rapid growth and wide adoption of cloud computing, the complexity of cloud infrastructures is increasing with a lot of challenges, on which the research community and industry are investing a lot of resources. One challenge is provision and continutiy of application performance, which is critical to both cloud privider and cloud usesr, because they mean reliable service, cost efficiency. For application performance optimization, there have been numerous researches about prediction of performance, which helps administrators and users make decision of resources sheduling, planning and allocation. Most of these researches come up with prediction methods with high accuracy. However, these prediction methods are ususally either cloud provider specific or application specific requiring huge extra works to apply them in actual sheduling or planning, moreover, these studies ususally cost the researchers a lot repeative intensive works in collecting data from cloud for experiments. Instead of spending large amount resources and works in answering questions like: what the performance it will be if this kind of application is running on my VMs. If the cloud provider can answer these questions, that will be very valuable to the cloud users and research community. For example, cloud provider can make suggestion to user the configuration of the VMs that is most efficient for specific usage to help usesrs make accurate placemnt descion to achieve high performance. But this is still an illusion which needs the researchers and industry work together to realize it. To achieve this, two of the challenges are (i) performance measurements of cloud infrastructures and (ii) categorization of different applications in cloud. For completion of this M.S. project, we will build a platform to collect and retain measurements data from cloud and a tool to categorize the applications running a VM.
