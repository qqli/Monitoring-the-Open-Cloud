\begin{abstract}

Performance optimization in IaaS clouds today is difficult because the user has little visibility into the performance characteristics and utilization of cloud components, and the cloud has little visibility into the application performance requirements and critical metrics (e.g., response time, throughput,..).  In this project we outline an agenda to reduce this information gap.  First, we will develop a platform that collects and retains rich information about a cloud to make that information available for analysis.  Second, we will build a tool that combines information from that platform and the user to characterize VMs.  This characterization and information collected from the platform can then be used by middleware, the user, or the cloud for performance optimization.  This work will be done in the context of the Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC), a new public cloud project that has the central goal of enabling open cloud research. Since the MOC is developed at BU, if this research is successful, it will be integrated into the large-scale production offering that we expect will be used by hundreds if not thousands of users.
